== Current

At the moment we have several cryptocurrencies' historical data for one year, with fields including open, close, high, low.
We have separate entites for them regardless that the fields used are exactly the same.

=== Questions & notes

* Is there a way to put them into one service using parameters?


== One service strategy

The one service strategy says that as the key (date) is consistent throughout the csv files, we can change the column names and put every data in one big file, and we can access them more easily.

== Computed fields for analysis

While we have raw data, it may not be the best if we want to apply more complex analyis for the user to enjoy
